I'm Xavier, a bi-lingual french speaker who has project managed worldwide tours for musicians over the last 7 years, created a livestreamed club night at the back of a lorry trailer container in South East London along the way and now focusing on tech.

I aspire to be a Full Stack developer and am currently taking a full time course at Makers Academy to formalise my self taught coding skills.

Throughout my education and career, I have stumbled upon technical barriers that could have easily been solved through a bit of code.

## Interests
- **Music**: from playing classical/baroque music on the recorder as a kid to heavy metal as rhythm guitar in high school or obsessively listening to electronic music now, music has always been a passion of mine.
- **Restoration**: I love restoring mid-century furniture, gutting things around the house to see how they work and _sometimes_ fix them.
- **Challenging**: I am fascinated by concepts totally alien to me especially those around the tech community whether philosophical (e.g [Lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)'s rationalism & AI) or more technical (e.g Hacker News) often leading me down rabbits holes for hours on end.
